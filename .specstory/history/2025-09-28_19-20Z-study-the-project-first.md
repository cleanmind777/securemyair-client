Based on my comprehensive study of this project, here's what I understand:

## **SecureMyAir Client - Project Overview**

This is a **React-based web application** for monitoring and controlling **HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems** and **air quality management**. The project appears to be a client-side application that connects to a backend API for real-time air quality monitoring and system control.

### **Key Features & Functionality:**

1. **Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time AQI (Air Quality Index) display with letter grades (A-F)
   - Environmental sensor readings: Humidity, CO₂, VOC, PM2.5, PM10
   - Temperature monitoring
   - Visual indicators with color-coded status (green=good, yellow=moderate, red=critical)

2. **HVAC System Control**
   - Fan control (2 fans)
   - UVC light control (2 units)
   - OSA (Outside Air) control
   - Cooling/Heating (C/H) control
   - System override capabilities

3. **Machine Management**
   - Multiple machine/device support
   - Machine selection interface
   - Individual machine dashboards

4. **Advertisement System**
   - Alternating display between HVAC data and advertisements
   - Configurable display durations
   - Support for both images and videos
   - Transition effects (diagonal, particles, mosaic, zoom)

5. **Authentication & Security**
   - Login system with email/password
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Password reset functionality
   - 2FA support (with bypass option)

### **Technical Stack:**

- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0 with Material-UI (MUI) v5
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v6
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Styling**: Material-UI with custom CSS
- **Build Tool**: Create React App
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js (for animations)

### **Project Structure:**

├── assests/                   # Images and static assets
└── App.js                     # Main application component
```

### **API Integration:**

The app connects to `https://api.securemyair.com/client` and makes calls to various PHP endpoints:
- `dashboard.php` - Air quality data
- `system.php` - HVAC control
- `miniMachines.php` - Machine list
- `advertisment.php` - Advertisement content
- `clientLogin.php` - Authentication

### **Current Status:**

The project appears to be a **production-ready application** with:
- ✅ Complete authentication system
- ✅ Real-time data monitoring
- ✅ System control capabilities
- ✅ Advertisement integration
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Professional UI/UX

The git status shows there are uncommitted changes to `AlternatingDisplay.jsx`, indicating recent development work on the advertisement display functionality.

This is a sophisticated **IoT dashboard application** designed for commercial HVAC and air quality management, likely used in buildings, offices, or industrial facilities to monitor and control air purification and climate systems.
